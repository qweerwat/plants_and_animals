# plants_and_animals
a game emulates the life and surviving of defferent creatures  
there are 3 types (species) of animals: *prey, predator* and *omni*:
*preys* are herbivorous, they can eat only *plants*
*predators* are carnivorous, they can eat only other animals
*omni* are omnivorous, they can eat both animals and plants.

plant can be poison, and an animal that tries to eat it will die.

all creatures have such attributes as *coordinates, age, mass, max age* and *aggression*.
animals have special attributes: *health, hunger* and *power*, which are important for fighting

if two creatures are in the same spot, they fight. predators and omnis attack only if they are hungry or angry. one with higher lever of _power_ wins.
critical levels of aggression and hunger are at the beggining

every day every creature gets older. if it is too old, it dies.
if animal is too hungry, it dies.

when everybody dies, game is over (happy end!)
